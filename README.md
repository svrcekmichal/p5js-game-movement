# p5js game movement

I've always found it fascinating to create some game, so in my poor attempt I'm sometimes playing with libs to find what it can do.

Code here is nothing production ready, it's mostly just mixing of some demos/examples I found somewhere else.

## what I used

- bootstraped with [p5-typescript-webpack-starter](https://github.com/expiredliver/p5-typescript-webpack-starter) from [expiredliver](https://github.com/expiredliver)
- [Interaction - Follow 1 example](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-follow-1.html) that helped a lot, by Keith Peters
and a lot of small parts here and there :)
